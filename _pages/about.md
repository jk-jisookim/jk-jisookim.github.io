Her focus extends from exploring the socio-economic implications of environmental policies and the intersection of technology and environmental justice. Her master's thesis was recently published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-024-01980-w"><i>Nature Climate Change</i></a>. Currently, she is engaged in a project titled <b>"Do speed cameras discriminate?"</b>
